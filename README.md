# 2DEulerSolver
This is a project to numerically solve the euler equations over a channel with a bump using jameson scheme finite volume analysis. The program is written in fortran as many CFD solvers are supercomputers which commonly use fortran. 

To install project: $ git clone https://github.com/FrostyNip/2DEulerSolver

Note: this project is not finished... It will give a solution but not the best solution.
